Release Instructions

Version Information

Releases shall be tagged following semantic version guidelines found at:
http://semver.org/

Versions after v1.1.0 will no longer have the "v" prefix. Autoconf now sets
the VERSION #define based on the output of git describe. See commit 2e8a07bc
for the details.

Version tags after v1.1.0 shall be signed. Valid known public keys can be reached by
referencing the annotated tags listed below:

william-roberts-pub

Verifying tags

Import the key into your keyring:
$ git show [annotated-tag-name] | gpg --import

Example:
$ git show william-roberts-pub | gpg --import

Verify the release tag:
$ git tag --verify [signed-tag-name]

Signing Release Tags

Ensure you have a key set up:

$ gpg --list-keys

If you don't generate one:
$ gpg --gen-key

Add that key to the gitconfig:
$ git config user.signingkey [gpg-key-id]

Make sure that key is reachable as an object in the repository:
$ gpg -a --export [gpg-key-id] | git hash-object -w --stdin [object SHA]
$ git tag -a [your-name-here]-pub [object SHA]

Make sure you push that tag:
$ git push origin [your-name-here]-pub
NOTE: this assumes origin is the tpm2.0-tools official repo.

After that, you can sign tags:
$ git tag --sign [signed-tag-name]

Push the tag to the repo:
$ git push origin [signed-tag-name]
NOTE: this assumes origin is the tpm2.0-tools official repo.
