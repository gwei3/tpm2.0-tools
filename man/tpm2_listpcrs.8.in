.SH NAME
tpm2_listpcrs\ - display all PCR values in given algorithm with -g, display given PCR values
in given algorithms with -L, or if no algorithm is given, output all algs.
Output file just contains all returned PCR values in binary format and in
0~23 order and in the requested order if multiple algs were requested. Assume
the caller know the pcr value length corresponding to the given bank/algorithm.
